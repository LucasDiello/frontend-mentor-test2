          <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,

          <p class="history1"> ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

          <h2>Such a life-changing<br> experience. Highly<br> recommended!</h2>

          <p class="history3"> ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code.<br> I needed some
            structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.<br> I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.<br> The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint.<br> They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.<br> The agile
            team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have.<br> In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience.<br> It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>

      <h2>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
        learning from their experiences was easy.</h2>

      <p class="history4"> ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
        program
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>
